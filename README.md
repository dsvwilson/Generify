# Generify

Generify is a project based on the Console that generates a 3-set message when the program is run. Each message comes from a different array of strings meaning there are 3 arrays. The program will randomly select an array element from each of the 3 arrays, feed them into a new array, convert them into a string, and print them to the Console alongside a message.

It is a practise on basic JavaScript syntax.
